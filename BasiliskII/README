Overview
--------

Basilisk II is an Open Source 68k Macintosh emulator. That is, it enables
you to run 68k MacOS software on you computer, even if you are using a
different operating system. However, you still need a copy of MacOS and
a Macintosh ROM image to use Basilisk II.

Basilisk II has currently been ported to the following systems:
  - BeOS R4 (PowerPC and x86)
  - Unix (tested under Linux, Solaris 2.x, FreeBSD 3.x, NetBSD 1.4.x and
    IRIX 6.5)
  - AmigaOS 3.x
  - Windows NT 4.0 (mostly works under Windows 95/98, too)
  - Mac OS X 10.1 thru 10.4

Some features of Basilisk II:
  - Emulates either a Mac Classic (which runs MacOS 0.x thru 7.5)
    or a Mac II series machine (which runs MacOS 7.x, 8.0 and 8.1),
    depending on the ROM being used
  - Color video display
  - CD quality sound output
  - Floppy disk driver (only 1.44MB disks supported)
  - Driver for HFS partitions and hardfiles
  - CD-ROM driver with basic audio functions
  - Easy file exchange with the host OS via a "Host Directory Tree" icon
    on the Mac desktop
  - Ethernet driver
  - Serial drivers
  - SCSI Manager (old-style) emulation
  - Emulates extended ADB keyboard and 3-button mouse
  - Uses UAE 68k emulation or (under AmigaOS and NetBSD/m68k) real 68k
    processor

The emulator is not yet complete. See the file "TODO" for a list of
unimplemented stuff.


Requirements and Installation
-----------------------------

Please consult the file "INSTALL" for a list of system requirements and
installation instructions.


Configuration
-------------

Basilisk II is configured via the preferences editor that appears on startup.
If you have a version without preferences editor (e.g. because of missing GTK+
under Unix), you have to edit the preferences file manually.

The settings are stored in a text file:

BeOS:
  /boot/home/config/settings/BasiliskII_prefs

Unix, Mac OS X:
  ~/.basilisk_ii_prefs

AmigaOS:
  ENV:BasiliskII_prefs

Windows:
  BasiliskII_prefs (in the same directory as the executable)

If no preferences file is present, Basilisk II will create one with the
default settings upon startup.


Preferences File Format
-----------------------

The preferences file is a text file editable with any text editor.
Each line in this file has the format "keyword value" and describes
one preferences item. For each keyword, the meaning of the "value"
string may vary across platforms. The following keywords exist:

disk <volume description>

  This item describes one MacOS volume to be mounted by Basilisk II.
  There can be multiple "disk" lines in the preferences file. Basilisk II
  can handle hardfiles (byte-per-byte images of HFS volumes in a file on
  the host system), HFS partitions on hard disks etc., and MacOS-partitioned
  disks (it can only access the first partition, though). The "volume
  description" is either the pathname of a hardfile or a platform-dependant
  description of an HFS partition or drive. If the volume description is
  prefixed by an asterisk ("*"), the volume is write protected for MacOS.

  Basilisk II can also handle some types of Mac "disk image" files directly,
  as long as they are uncompressed and unencoded.

  BeOS:
    To specify an HFS partition, simply specify its path (e.g.
    "/dev/disk/scsi/0/1/0/0_3"). If you don't specify any volumes, Basilisk II
    will search for and use all available HFS partitions.

  Unix:
    To specify an HFS partition, simply specify its path (e.g. "/dev/sda5").
    If you want to access a MacOS-partitioned hard disk or removable volume
    (Jaz, Zip etc.) and your operating system doesn't understand MacOS
    partition tables, you can specify the block device name (e.g. "/dev/sda")
    to access the first HFS partition on the device. Under Linux, if you
    don't specify any volumes, Basilisk II will search /etc/fstab for
    unmounted HFS partitions and use these.

  AmigaOS:
    Partitions/drives are specified in the following format:
      /dev/<device name>/<unit>/<open flags>/<start block>/<size>/<block size>
    "start block" and "size" are given in blocks, "block size" is given in
    bytes.

  Windows:
    To define a logical volume (Windows NT only), specify its path (e.g. "c:\").
    To define a physical volume (NT and 9x), additionally give the "physical"
    keyword (E.g. "physical c:\"). For safety reasons, volumes are mounted as
    read-only. This is due to the bugs in PC Exchange. If you don't specify
    any volume, the files *.hfv and *.dsk are searched from the current
    directory. Note that in this case, Basilisk II tries to boot from the first
    volume file found, which is random and may not be what you want.

floppy <floppy drive description>

  This item describes one floppy drive to be used by Basilisk II. There
  can be multiple "floppy" lines in the preferences file. If no "floppy"
  line is given, Basilisk II will try to automatically detect and use
  installed floppy drives. The format of the "floppy drive description"
  is the same as that of "disk" lines.

cdrom <CD-ROM drive description>

  This item describes one CD-ROM drive to be used by Basilisk II. There
  can be multiple "cdrom" lines in the preferences file. If no "cdrom"
  line is given, Basilisk II will try to automatically detect and use
  installed CD-ROM drives. The format of the "CD-ROM drive description"
  is the same as that of "disk" lines.

extfs <direcory path>

  This item specifies the root directory for the "Host Directory Tree"
  file system (the "Unix/BeOS/Amiga/..." icon on the Finder desktop).
  All objects contained in that directory are accessible by Mac applications.

  This feature is only available when File System Manager V1.2 or later
  is installed on the Mac side. FSM 1.2 is built-in beginning with MacOS 7.6
  and can be installed as a system extension (downloadable from Apple, look
  for the FSM SDK in the developer section) for earlier MacOS versions.

scsi0 <SCSI target> ... scsi6 <SCSI target>

  These items describe the SCSI target to be used for a given Mac SCSI
  ID by Basilisk II. Basilisk II emulates the old SCSI Manager and allows
  to assign a different SCSI target (they don't even have to be on the
  same SCSI bus) for each SCSI ID (0..6) as seen by the MacOS. "scsi0"
  describes the target for ID 0, "scsi1" the target for ID 1 etc.
  The format of the "SCSI target" is platform specific.

  BeOS:
    The "SCSI target" has the format "<bus>/<unit>" (e.g. "0/2").
    Due to a bug in BeOS, using SCSI with Basilisk II may cause the
    SCSI bus to hang. Use with caution.

  Linux:
    The "SCSI target" has to be the name of a device that complies to
    the Generic SCSI driver API. On a standard Linux installation, these
    devices are "/dev/sg0", "/dev/sg1" etc. Note that you must have
    appropriate access rights to these devices and that Generic SCSI
    support has to be compiled into the kernel.

  FreeBSD:
    The "SCSI target" has the format "<id>/<lun>" (e.g. "2/0").

  AmigaOS:
    The "SCSI target" has the format "<device name>/<unit>" (e.g.
    "scsi.device/2").

  Windows:
    The "SCSI target" has the format <"Vendor"> <"Model"> (e.g.
    scsi0 "HP" "CD-Writer+ 7100"). Note the use of quotes.

screen <video mode>

  This item describes the type of video display to be used by default for
  Basilisk II. If you are using a Mac Classic ROM, the display is always
  1-bit 512x342 and this item is ignored. The format of the "video mode" is
  platform specific.

  BeOS:
    The "video mode" is one of the following:
      win/<width>/<height>
        8-bit color display in a window of the given size. This is the
        default.
      scr/<mode>
        Full-screen display in BWindowScreen. <mode> is the bit number of
        the video mode to use (see headers/be/interface/GraphicsDefs.h).
        E.g. 0 = 640x480x8, 1 = 800x600x8 etc., 10 = 640x480x24,
        11 = 800x600x24 etc., 18 = 640x480x15, 19 = 800x600x15 etc.
        15 bit modes are preferable to 16 bit modes (which may show false
        colors on PowerPC machines).
    When you run in full-screen mode and switch to another Workspace,
    Basilisk II is put in "suspend" mode (i.e. MacOS will be frozen).

  Unix:
    The "video mode" is one of the following:
      win/<width>/<height>
        Color display in an X11 window of the given size. There are several
        resolutions and color depths available. The set of color depths
        depends on the capabilities of the X11 server, the operating system,
        and Basilisk II compile-time options, but 1 bit and the default depth
        of the X11 screen should always be available.
      dga/<width>/<height>
        [if Basilisk II was configured with --enable-xf86-dga]
        Full-screen display using the XFree86 DGA extension. The color depth
        (8/15/24 bit) depends on the depth of the underlying X11 screen.
        "width" and "height" specify the maximum width/height to use.
        Saying "dga/0/0" means "complete screen".
      dga/<frame buffer name>
        [if Basilisk II was configured with --enable-fbdev-dga]
        Full-screen display using the frame buffer device /dev/fb. The color
        depth (8/15/24 bit) depends on the depth of the underlying X11 screen.
        The "frame buffer name" is looked up in the "fbdevices" file (whose
        path can be specified with the "fbdevicefile" prefs item) to determine
        certain characteristics of the device (doing a "ls -l /dev/fb" should
        tell you what your frame buffer name is).

  AmigaOS:
    The "video mode" is one of the following:
      win/<width>/<height>
        Black-and-white display in a window of the given size on the
        Workbench screen. This is the default and will also be used when
        one of the other options (PIP/screen) fails to open.
      pip/<width>/<height>
        15-bit truecolor display in a Picasso96 PIP. This requires
        Picasso96 as well as a PIP-capable graphics card (e.g. Picasso IV).
      scr/<hexadecimal mode ID>
        8/15/24-bit fullscreen display on a Picasso96/CyberGraphX screen with
        the given mode ID. This requires Picasso96 or CyberGraphX. For 15 and
        24 bit, the frame buffer format must be QuickDraw-compatible
        (big-endian, xRGB 1:5:5:5 or xRGB 8:8:8:8). The screen size will be
        the default size for that mode ID.

  Windows:
    The "video mode" is one of the following:
      win/<width>/<height>/<bits per pixel>
        A refreshed screen mode that uses Windows GDI calls to write to the
        screen. You may have other windows on top of Basilisk II.
      dx/<width>/<height>/<bits per pixel>
        A refreshed DirectX mode (minimum version 5.0). There are ways to
        install DirectX 5 on NT 4. Some new display adapters work fine even
        with DirectX 3.
      fb/<width>/<height>/<bits per pixel>
        A non-refreshed video mode that works only on NT. It accesses the
        linear frame buffer directly (best performance of all three modes).
        Use the hotkey Control-Shift-F12 to switch between Windows and Mac
        displays. Fast task switch (Alt-Tab) and Explorer start menu
        (Control-Esc) are disabled, Control-Alt-Del is enabled.
    <width> and <height> can be either zeroes (uses current screen values),
    or something else. "win" mode can use almost anything, for other modes
    there must be a corresponding DirectX mode.
    <bits> is ignored for mode "win" (uses current screen values).
    If the mode is "win" and the dimensions are different than the desktop
    dimensions, windowed mode is used. The window can be moved around by
    dragging with the right mouse button. This mode remembers window positions
    separately for different dimensions.
    The supported values are 8,15,16,24,32. It is possible that some of them
    do not work for you. In particular, it may be that only one of the
    two modes, 15 and 16, is suitable for your card. You need to find out
    the best solution by experimenting.
    Basilisk II checks what display mode you are currently running and uses
    that mode. The screen is always full screen. When you switch to another
    application via Alt-Tab, Basilisk II is put in "snooze" mode (i.e. MacOS
    is frozen).

  Mac OS X:
    The "video mode" is one of the following:
      win/<width>/<height>
      win/<width>/<height>/<bits per pixel>
        A refreshed (and buffered) Quartz window.
      full/<width>/<height>
      full/<width>/<height>/<bits per pixel>
        A CGDirectDisplay full screen mode. <bits> can currently be 8, 16 or 32.
        If not specified, the default is 32. There is currently no way to switch
        between the Mac OS X and Basilisk II display, but Apple-Option-Escape
        instantly and safely terminates the Basilisk II program.

seriala <serial port description>

  This item describes the serial port to be used as Port A (Modem Port)
  by Basilisk II. If no "seriala" line is given, Basilisk II will try to
  automatically detect and use installed serial ports. The "serial port
  description" is a platform-dependant description of a serial port.

  BeOS:
    Either specify the name of a serial port (e.g. "serial1") or one of
    "parallel1", "parallel2" or "parallel3". See below for more information
    about parallel ports.

  Unix:
    Specify the device name of a serial port (e.g. "/dev/ttyS0") or a
    parallel "lp" port (e.g. "/dev/lp1"; this only works under Linux and
    FreeBSD). See below for more information about parallel ports.

  AmigaOS:
    You have to specify the name of the serial device and the device unit
    as "<device name>/<unit>" (e.g. "serial.device/0"). If the given device
    is not compatible to serial.device, Basilisk II will crash. If the
    device name starts with an asterisk (e.g. "*parallel.device/0"), the
    device is treated as a parallel.device compatible device. See below for
    more information about parallel ports.

  Windows:
    Specify "COM1" or "COM2" for com port 1 or 2, respectively.

  Parallel ports: If you select a parallel port it will look like a serial
  port to MacOS but Basilisk II will only allow data output and ignore baud
  rate settings etc. You should be able to get some printers to work with
  this method (provided that you have the right printer driver, like
  "Power Print" (see www.gdt.com)).

serialb <serial port description>

  This item describes the serial port to be used as Port B (Printer Port)
  by Basilisk II. If no "serialb" line is given, Basilisk II will try to
  automatically detect and use installed serial ports. The format of the
  "serial port description" is the same as that of the "seriala" option.

ether <ethernet card description>

  This item describes the Ethernet card to be used for Ethernet networking
  by Basilisk II. If no "ether" line is given, Ethernet networking is disabled
  (although the Ethernet driver of Basilisk II will behave like a "dummy"
  Ethernet card in this case). If you are using a Mac Classic ROM, Ethernet
  is not available and this setting is ignored. The "ethernet card description"
  is a platform-dependant description of an ethernet card.

  General note: To use TCP/IP from MacOS, you should assign a different IP
  address to the MacOS (entered into the MacOS TCP/IP (or MacTCP) control
  panel). Otherwise there will be confusion about which operating system will
  handle incoming packets.

  BeOS:
    It doesn't matter what you give as "ethernet card description", Basilisk II
    will always use the first Ethernet card it finds as long an an "ether"
    line exists (e.g. say "ether yes"). Using Ethernet requires the "sheep_net"
    Net Server add-on to be installed. The first time you start Basilisk II
    with Ethernet enabled you will be asked whether it's OK to make the
    necessary changes to your BeOS network configuration to enable sheep_net.

  Linux:
    The "ethernet card description" is the name of an Ethernet interface.
    There are four approaches to networking with Basilisk II:

      1. Direct access to an Ethernet card via the "sheep_net" kernel module.
         The "ethernet card description" must be the name of a real Ethernet
         card, e.g. "eth0".

         The sheep_net module is included in the Basilisk II source
         distribution in the directory "src/Unix/Linux/NetDriver". You have
         to compile and install the module yourself:

           $ su
           [enter root password]
           # make
           # make dev
           [this will create a /dev/sheep_net device node; you should give
            appropriate access rights to the user(s) running Basilisk II]
           # insmod sheep_net.o

         If you copy the sheep_net.o module to a place where it can be found
         by the kernel module loader ("/lib/modules/<version>/kernel/drivers/net"
         for 2.4 kernels) and add the line

           alias char-major-10-198 sheep_net

         to "/etc/modules.conf", the kernel should be able to load the module
         automatically when Basilisk II is started.

         The sheep_net module will allow you to run all networking protocols
         under MacOS (TCP/IP, AppleTalk, IPX etc.) but there is no connection
         between Linux networking and MacOS networking. MacOS will only be
         able to talk to other machines on the Ethernet, but not to other
         networks that your Linux box routes (e.g. a second Ethernet or a PPP
         connection to the Internet).

      2. Putting Basilisk II on a virtual Ethernet via the "ethertap" device.
         In this case, the "ethernet card description" must be the name
         of an ethertap interface, e.g. "tap0". It also requires that you
         configure your kernel to enable routing and ethertap support:
         under "Networking options", enable "Kernel/User netlink socket" and
         "Netlink device emulation", under "Network device support", activate
         "Ethertap network tap". You also have to modify drivers/net/ethertap.c
         a bit before compiling the new kernel:

          - insert "#define CONFIG_ETHERTAP_MC 1" near the top (after the
            #include lines)
          - comment out the line "dev->flags|=IFF_NOARP;" in ethertap_probe()

         Next, see /usr/src/linux/Documentation/networking/ethertap.txt for
         information on how to set up /dev/tap* device nodes and activate the
         ethertap interface. Under MacOS, select an IP address that is on the
         virtual network and set the default gateway to the IP address of the
         ethertap interface. This approach will let you access all networks
         that your Linux box has access to (especially, if your Linux box has
         a dial-up Internet connection and is configured for IP masquerading,
         you can access the Internet from MacOS). The drawback is that you
         can only use network protocols that Linux can route, so you have to
         install and configure netatalk if you want to use AppleTalk. Here is
         an example /etc/atalk/atalkd.conf for a LAN:

           eth0 -seed -phase 2 -net 1 -addr 1.47 -zone "Ethernet"
           tap0 -seed -phase 2 -net 2 -addr 2.47 -zone "Basilisknet"

         (the "47" is an arbitrary node number). This will set up a zone
         "Ethernet" (net 1) for the Ethernet and a zone "Basilisknet" (net 2)
         for the internal network connection of the ethertap interface.
         MacOS should automatically recognize the nets and zones upon startup.
         If you are in an existing AppleTalk network, you should contact
         your network administrator about the nets and zones you can use
         (instead of the ones given in the example above).

      3. Access the network through a "tuntap" interface.
         The "ethernet card description" must be set to "tun".

         TUN/TAP provides packet reception and transmission for user
         space programs.  It can be viewed as a simple Point-to-Point
         or Ethernet device, which instead of receiving packets from a
         physical media, receives them from user space program and
         instead of sending packets via physical media writes them to
         the user space program.

         Prerequisites:
         - Make sure the "tun" kernel module is loaded

             # modprobe tun

         - If you wish to route IP packets from Basilisk II, make sure
           IP Forwarding is enabled on your system (not required for
           bridging)

             # echo 1 >/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

         A virtual network configuration script is required in order
         to configure the tunN interface after it is created, and the
         default is /usr/local/BasiliskII/tunconfig unless you specify
         a different file with the "etherconfig" item.

         The default "tunconfig" script configures the tunN interface
         for IP NAT.  It requires that "sudo" is properly configured
         so that "/sbin/ifconfig" and "/sbin/iptables" can be executed
         as root. Otherwise, you can still write a helper script which
         invokes your favorite program to elevate user privileges.
         e.g. in a KDE environment, kdesu can be used as follows:

           #!/bin/sh
           exec /usr/bin/kdesu -c /path/to/tunconfig $1 $2

         As an alternative to configuring IP on the tunN interface,
         you may attach it to a bridge, which will enable AppleTalk
         frames to be forwarded without Linux needing to route them.
         No tunconfig-like script is provided to configure bridging,
         but you may simply configure "etherconfig /bin/true" to skip
         the automatic configuration and then configure bridging
         manually once Basilisk II has started, e.g.:

           # ifconfig tun0 up
           # brctl addif bridge1 tun0

      4. Access the network through the user mode network stack.
         (the code and this documentation come from QEMU)

         By setting the "ethernet card description" to "slirp",
         Basilisk II uses a completely user mode network stack (you
         don't need root priviledges to use the virtual network). The
         virtual network configuration is the following:

           Basilisk II <------> Firewall/DHCP server <-----> Internet
           (10.0.2.x)      |         (10.0.2.2)
                           |
                           ----> DNS server (10.0.2.3)
                           |
                           ----> SMB server (10.0.2.4)

         Basilisk II behaves as if it was behind a firewall which
         blocks all incoming connections. You can use a DHCP client to
         automatically configure the network in Basilisk II.

         In order to check that the user mode network is working, you
         can ping the address 10.0.2.2 and verify that you got an
         address in the range 10.0.2.x from the Basilisk II virtual
         DHCP server.

         Note that ping is not supported reliably to the internet as
         it would require root priviledges. It means you can only ping
         the local router (10.0.2.2).

         When using the built-in TFTP server, the router is also the
         TFTP server.

  FreeBSD:
    The "ethertap" method described above also works under FreeBSD, but since
    no-one has found the time to write a section for this manual, you're on
    your own here...

  AmigaOS:
    You have to specify the name of the SANA-II Ethernet device and the device
    unit as "<device name>/<unit>" (e.g. "ariadne.device/0"). If the given
    device is not a SANA-II device, Basilisk II will crash. If the device is
    not an Ethernet device, Basilisk II will display a warning message and
    disable Ethernet networking.

  Mac OS X:
    The "slirp" method described above now seems to work.


  See the next item for an alternative way to do networking with Basilisk II.

udptunnel <"true" or "false">

  Setting this to "true" enables a special network mode in which all network
  packets sent by MacOS are tunnelled over UDP using the host operating
  system's native TCP/IP stack. This can only be used to connect computers
  running Basilisk II (and not, for example, for connecting to the Internet
  or an AppleShare server running on a real Mac), but it is probably the
  easiest way to set up a network between two instances of Basilisk II
  because the UDP tunnelling doesn't require any special kernel modules or
  network add-ons. It relies on IP broadcasting, however, so its range is
  limited. It should be fine though for doing a little file sharing or
  playing Spectre.

udpport <IP port number>

  This item specifies the IP port number to use for the "UDP Tunnel" mode.
  The default is 6066.

redir <port redirection description>

  This item defines a port to be forwarded from the host to the client. 
  The format is "[protocol]:hostport:[clientaddress]:clientport", where
  protocol is "udp" or "tcp" (default), hostport is the port on your
  computer to forward to the Mac, clientaddress is the IP address of the Mac
  in the virtual network (defaults to 10.0.2.15), and clientport is the port on
  the Mac to be exposed. For example, if you have a web server in MacOS running
  on port 80, you can expose it as port 8000 with the line below:

  redir tcp:8000:10.0.2.15:80

rom <ROM file path>

  This item specifies the file name of the Mac ROM file to be used by
  Basilisk II. If no "rom" line is given, the ROM file has to be named
  "ROM" and put in the same directory as the Basilisk II executable.

bootdrive <drive number>

  Specify MacOS drive number of boot volume. "0" (the default) means
  "boot from first bootable volume".

bootdriver <driver number>

  Specify MacOS driver number of boot volume. "0" (the default) means
  "boot from first bootable volume". Use "-62" to boot from CD-ROM.

ramsize <bytes>

  Allocate "bytes" bytes of RAM for MacOS system and application memory.
  The value given will be rounded down to the nearest multiple of 1MB.
  If you are using a Mac Classic ROM, the maximum available value is 4MB
  and higher values will be ignored. The default is 8MB.

frameskip <frames to skip>

  For refreshed graphics modes (usually window modes), this specifies
  how many frames to skip after drawing one frame. Higher values make
  the video display more responsive but require more processing power.
  The default is "8". Under Unix/X11, a value of "0" selects a "dynamic"
  update mode that cuts the display into rectangles and updates each
  rectangle individually, depending on display changes.

modelid <MacOS model ID>

  Specifies the Macintosh model ID that Basilisk II should report to MacOS.
  The default is "5" which corresponds to a Mac IIci. If you want to run
  MacOS 8, you have to set this to "14" (Quadra 900). Other values are not
  officially supported and may result in crashes. MacOS versions earlier
  than 7.5 may only run with the Model ID set to "5". If you are using a Mac
  Classic ROM, the model is always "Mac Classic" and this setting is
  ignored.

nosound <"true" or "false">

  Set this to "true" to disable all sound output. This is useful if the
  sound takes too much CPU time on your machine or to get rid of warning
  messages if Basilisk II can't use your audio hardware.

nocdrom <"true" or "false">

  Set this to "true" to disable Basilisk's built-in CD-ROM driver.
  The only reason to do this is if you want to use a third-party CD-ROM
  driver that uses the SCSI Manager. The default is "false".

nogui <"true" or "false">

  Set this to "true" to disable the GUI preferences editor and GUI
  error alerts. All errors will then be reported to stdout. The default
  is "false".

keyboardtype <keyboard-id>

  Specifies the keyboard type that BasiliskII should report to the MacOS.
  The default is "5" which is a "Apple Extended Keyboard II (ISO)",
  but many other numbers are understood by most versions of the MacOS
  (e.g. 11 is a "Macintosh Plus Keyboard with keypad",
        13 is a "Apple PowerBook Keyboard (ISO)" )

For additional information, consult the source.


System-specific configuration
-----------------------------

Unix:

  keycodes <"true" or "false">
  keycodefile <keycodes file path>

    By default, the X11 event handler in Basilisk II uses KeySyms to
    translate keyboard event to Mac keycodes. While this method is very
    compatible and ought to work with all X servers, it only works well
    if your keyboard has a US layout. If you set "keycodes" to "true",
    Basilisk II will use raw keycodes instead of KeySyms. The keycode
    depends only on the physical location of a key on the keyboard and
    not on the selected keymap. Unfortunately it depends on the X server
    being used and possibly also on the type of keyboard attached. So
    Basilisk II needs a table to translate X keycodes to Mac keycodes.
    This table is read by default from /usr/local/share/BasiliskII/keycodes
    unless you specify a different file with the "keycodefile" item.
    A sample keycode file is included with Basilisk II.

  fbdevicefile <fbdevices file path>

    This option specifies the file that contains frame buffer device
    specifications for the fbdev-DGA video mode (when Basilisk II was
    configured with --enable-fbdev-dga). The default location of the file
    is /usr/local/share/BasiliskII/fbdevices. A sample file is included
    with Basilisk II.

  mousewheelmode <mode>

    If you have a mouse with a wheel, this option specifies whether moving
    the wheel will be reported to the MacOS as "Page up/down" (mode 0) or
    "Cursor up/down" (mode 1) keys.

  mousewheellines <number of lines>

    If "mousewheelmode" is set to mode 1 (Cursor up/down), this option sets
    the number of key events sent to MacOS for each wheel movement (the
    number of lines to scroll).

  ignoresegv <"true" or "false">

    Set this to "true" to ignore illegal memory accesses. The default
    is "false". This feature is only implemented on the following
    platforms: Linux/x86, Linux/ppc, Darwin/ppc.

  dsp <device name>
  mixer <device name>

    Under Linux and FreeBSD, this specifies the devices to be used for sound
    output and volume control, respectively. The defaults are "/dev/dsp" and
    "/dev/mixer".

AmigaOS:

  sound <sound output description>

    This item specifies what method to use for sound output. The only choice
    is currently AHI, but you can specify the AHI mode ID to be used. The
    "sound output description" looks like this:

      ahi/<hexadecimal mode ID>

  scsimemtype <type>

    This item controls the type of memory to use for SCSI buffers. Possible
    values are:
      0 Chip memory
      1 24-bit DMA capable memory
      2 Any memory

    Be warned that many SCSI host adapters will not work with the "Any memory"
    setting. Basilisk II has no way of knowing which memory type is supported
    by the host adapter and setting an unsupported type will result in data
    corruption.

Windows:

  noscsi <"true" or "false">

    Completely disables SCSI Manager support when set to "true".
    Note that currently all SCSI operations are executed synchronously,
    even if Mac application has requested asynchronous operation. What this
    means is that the control is not returned to the application until the
    command is completely finished. Normally this is not an issue, but when a
    CDR/CDRW is closed or erased the burner program typically wants to wait in
    some progress dialog the result may be that the application reports a
    time-out error, but the operation completes all right anyway.

  nofloppyboot <"true" or "false">

    Set this to "true" to disable booting from a floppy.

  replacescsi <"Vendor1"> <"Model1"> <"Vendor2"> <"Model2">

    This command tricks the Mac to believe that you have a SCSI device Model2
    from vendor Vendor2, although your real hardware is Model1 from Vendor1.
    This is very useful since many devices have almost identical ATAPI and SCSI
    versions of their hardware, and MacOS applications usually support the SCSI
    version only. The example below is typical:

      replacescsi "HP" "CD-Writer+ 7100" "PHILIPS" "CDD3600"

    Note the use of quotes.

  rightmouse <0/1>

    Defines what the right mouse button is used for. The default values of 0
    means that it is used to move windowed mode BasiliskII screen.
    Value 1 sends a combination Control and mouse click to the MacOS.
    This may be useful under OS versions 8 and above.

  keyboardfile <path>

    Defines the path of the customized keyboard code file.

  pollmedia <"true" or "false">

    If true (default), tries to automatically detect new media.
    Applies to all "floppy", "cd" or "disk" removable media except
    1.44 MB floppies. May cause modest slow down. If unchecked, 
    use Ctrl-Shift-F11 to manually mount new media.
    If you have auto-insert notification (AIN) enabled, you may turn this
    option off. Note that some CD related software require AIN,
    and some other need it to be turned off. Consult the documentation
    of your CD software to learn which one is optimal for you.

  framesleepticks <milliseconds>

    The amount of time between video frames.

  showfps <true/false>

    If true, the real frame rate is displayed.

  stickymenu <true/false>

    If true, the main menu bar is kept open even after the mouse button is
    released, under all OS versions (OS 8 has this feature already). There
    are extensions to do the same thing, but it's faster to handle this in
    native code. Default is "true".

  ntdx5hack <"true" or "false">

    You may need this on NT if your display adapter driver has a bug in
    DirectX palette support. Black and white are reversed. It fixes the
    palette issue by using GDI palette instead of D3D palette. Default is
    false.


JIT-specific configuration
--------------------------

A Just-In-Time (JIT) translation engine is available for x86. This is
aimed at translating 68040 instructions to native equivalent code
sequences, thus providing faster emulation speeds.

  jit <"true" or "false">

    Set this to "true" to enable the JIT compiler. Default value is
    "true" if the JIT compiler was compiled in. Besides, this is
    effective only if Basilisk II is configured to emulate a 68040.

  jitfpu <"true" or "false">

    Set this to "true" to enable translation of floating-point (FPU)
    instructions. Default is "true".

  jitcachesize <size>

    Allocate "size" kilobytes of RAM for the translation cache. The
    value given will be rounded down to the nearest multiple of a page
    size. Minimal value is "2048" (2MB). Default value is "8192" (8MB).

  jitlazyflush <"true" or "false">

    Set this to "true" to enable lazy invalidation of the translation
    cache. This is always recommended as it usually makes the system
    more responsive and faster, especially while running MacOS
    8.X. Default value is "true".

  jitdebug <"true" or "false">

    Set this to "true" to enable the JIT debugger. This requires a
    build of Basilisk II with the cxmon debugger. Default is "false".


Usage
-----

Quitting:
  The right way to quit Basilisk II is to select the "Shut Down" menu item
  from the Finder's "Special" menu. You should not kill it from the shell
  unless it hangs. Under Unix, pressing "Esc" while holding the Ctrl key will
  also quit Basilisk II (in case you are using it in DGA mode and it crashed).
  Under Windows, try Alt-F4 (or Control-Alt-Del to log off and back on again
  if it crashes really badly).

Suspending:
  The Unix version of Basilisk II can be suspended while running in DGA mode
  by pressing "Tab" while holding the Ctrl key. Pressing "Space" in the
  "suspended" window will resume the emulation. Under BeOS, switching to
  a different Workspace when BasiliskII is in full-screen mode will also
  suspend the emulation.

Keyboard:
  On PC-style keyboards, "Alt" is the Mac "Command" key, while the "Windows"
  key is the Mac "Option" key.

Mouse:
  Under Unix, pressing Ctrl-F5 while the Basilisk II window is active will
  grab the mouse. This is needed for compatibility with some MacOS programs,
  especially games such as flight simulators. Press Ctrl-F5 again to return
  to normal mouse operation.

Floppy:
  Basilisk II can only handle 1.44MB MFM floppies. Depending on your platform,
  floppy disk changes might not be detected automatically. Under Unix, press
  Ctrl-F1 to mount a floppy. Under BeOS, select the appropriate "Mount" menu
  item or press Ctrl-F1 to mount a floppy. Under Windows, press Ctrl-Shift-F11.

HFS partitions:
  Having HFS partitions mounted for read-write access under Basilisk II while
  they are also mounted on the host OS will most likely result in volume
  corruption and data loss. Unmount your HFS volumes before starting
  Basilisk II.

ZIP drives:
  Iomega ZIP disks can be mounted either with the "disk" prefs item or (on
  platforms that support the SCSI Manager emulation of Basilisk II) by
  installing the IomegaWare on the Mac side. Do not use both ways
  simultaneously!

Hardfiles:
  In addition to plain images of HFS volumes, Basilisk II can also handle
  some types of Mac "disk image" files, as long as they are uncompressed
  and unencoded.

Mac Classic emulation:
  Sound output and Ethernet are not supported if you are using a Mac Classic
  ROM. Also, the video display is fixed to 512x342 in monochrome. The AmigaOS
  and BeOS/PPC versions of Basilisk II cannot do Mac Classic emulation.

Video resolution switching:
  Run-time switching of video resolutions requires the Display Manager. This
  is included in MacOS versions 7.6 and above, and available as a system
  extension for earlier MacOS versions as a free download from ftp.apple.com
  (look for "Display Software 2.x"). Click on "Options..." in the "Monitors"
  control panel to select the resolution.

Sound output:
  Sound output under Basilisk II requires Sound Manager 3.0 or later. This
  is included in MacOS versions 7.5 and above, and available as a system
  extension for earlier MacOS versions as a free download from ftp.apple.com.
  Sample rate, bit resolution and mono/stereo can be selected in the Sound
  control panel (section "Sound Out").

Ethernet:
  Basilisk II supports all Ethernet protocols. Running a protocol under
  Basilisk II that already runs within the host operating system on the same
  network card (e.g. running MacTCP under Basilisk II on a BeOS machine) may
  or may not work (generally, it should work, but some specific things like
  "ping" may not). If you have problems with FTP, try setting the FTP client
  to passive mode.

LocalTalk:
  LocalTalk is not supported by Basilisk II. There is no way of getting
  LocalTalk to work with the serial drivers of Basilisk II. Any attempt to
  activate LocalTalk will either result in a crash or revert to Ethernet.

Serial:
  You can use the serial ports in Basilisk II to connect to the Internet
  with a modem and the "MacPPP" or "Open Transport/PPP" software.

Bug reports
-----------

You found a bug? Well, use the source, fix it and send the fix to
  <Christian.Bauer@uni-mainz.de>
for inclusion in the next release of Basilisk II.

If you don't have a fix, you should post a bug report using the Source Forge
bug tracker, supplying as much information as possible (operating system and
versions of Basilisk II and MacOS being used, relevant hardware information,
the exact steps to reproduce the bug, etc.):
  http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=2123&atid=102123

I also strongly suggest reading this before posting a bug report:

Author
------

You can contact me at <Christian.Bauer@uni-mainz.de>, but please don't do
so unless absolutely necessary. I'm maintaining Basilisk II in my spare
time and am not able to provide technical support for everyone. If you have
questions, consider posting them to one of the support forums mentioned
below.

You are encouraged to contact me personally when
 - you have bug fixes or small enhancements for the code
 - you want to port Basilisk II to another platform
 - you want to discuss technical issues
 - you intend to make major changes to the source; you might be working on
   something that I have already done, or I may have different ideas about
   the Right Way to do it

There is no point in sending me questions about
 - ROM files and how/where to get them
 - versions of Basilisk II that run on operating systems other than Unix,
   BeOS and AmigaOS. If you are using any other operating system, there's
   no point in asking me how to to X or why Y doesn't work because I won't
   know either. Instead, you should look in the "Acknowledgements" section
   of this manual to find the person responsible. For example, if your
   question is specific to the Windows operating system, ask Lauri Pesonen.
   I don't have Windows and can't answer your questions and I'm too lazy to
   forward mail to Lauri myself. In any case, it would probably be better
   to post your questions to a public forum as it will get a much wider
   audience there.
