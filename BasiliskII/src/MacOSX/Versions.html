Versions of MacOS X port of Basilisk II:
<OL>
<LI>Initial port to Public Beta, made minor changes to get it to compile under Final Release.
	<BR>Gave a copy of this version to Gwenole Beauchesne (one of the other porters)</LI>
<LI>Ported to version 0.9 of the Basilisk II tarball.
	<BR>Re-engineered autoconfig files to give a clean autoconf and make of cpu_uae code.
	<BR>Fixed a bug in the EmulatorView class (I was customising release instead of dealloc).
	<BR>Added:
		<UL>
		<LI>Transparency to icon</LI>
		<LI>Port-specific doco: 0_HOW_TO_BUILD.txt, ToDo.html and Versions.html</LI>
		<LI>Screen Snapshot code</LI>
		<LI>Preferences saving and resetting</LI>
		<LI>Delegate code, called when user attempts to close emulator window or quit application,
			to check whether preferences need saving or application should be allowed to quit</LI>
		<LI>ExtFS resource and type/creator access code</LI>
		<LI>Window resizing stuff:
			<OL>
			<LI>The screensize can be set in the preferences. If the emulator has yet to
				start then the window and emulator screen is resized. Otherwise, and</LI>
			<LI>At any time, the window can be resized, which scales the emulator screen image</LI>
			</OL>
			</LI>
		</UL>
	<BR>Gave a copy of this to Max Horn</LI>
<LI>Some code fixes suggested by Max, doco updates, and porting to OS 10.1</LI>
<LI>Event handling re-write inspired by Max (subclassing NSApplication for custom sendEvent:).
	Command key and double clicks are now passed correctly to the Emulator. Took out the custom
	"About" window stuff, and added some credits (with an html link to the official Basilisk home
	page) in the standard About box. Also has the standard README in the help menu.
	<BR>Gave a copy to Max</LI>
<LI>Streamlining of event sending (filter mouseMoved events when not in Emulator screen)</LI>
<LI>Recompile in Project Builder, because the makefile generated binary dies at startup</LI>
<LI>Ported to the Basilisk II 1.0 snapshot's source and implemented video resolution switching.
	Also uses Objective-C++, which eliminates some of the wrapper code which was previously needed.</LI>
<LI>Video preferences fixes, small tidyup of source.</LI>
<LI>Full screen mode added, more source tidied up.</LI>
<!-- v10><-->
<LI>Finally checked into CVS repository.
	<BR>Key event bug fixes:
	<UL>
		<LI>Cursor keys are now decoded and passed to the Emulator correctly</LI>
		<LI>New one (in version 9) reported by Kentaro Nakatani -
			full screen mode was not passing key events</LI>
	</UL></LI>
<LI>Repaired help menu item, added documentation folder.</LI>
<LI>Several monitor resolution-changing fixes. Windowed mode now supports all depths, and is up to 6 times faster. I now no longer have any plans to do an OpenGL mode.
	<BR>Minor change in preferences (RAM size fields no longer require
	the user to press return or enter for the value to "take").
	<BR>Some modifications for compilation on 10.2 <I>and</I> 10.1
	<BR>Initial CD-ROM reading code.</LI>
</OL>
